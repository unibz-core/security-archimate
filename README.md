## A Proposal of Redesign Security Modeling in ArchiMate

[ArchiMate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate) is an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language to support the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains. ArchiMate is a technical standard from The Open Group and is based on concepts from the now superseded IEEE 1471 standard.

The ["Risk and Security Overlay”](https://pure.unamur.be/ws/portalfiles/portal/12366722/Modeling_Enterprise_Risk_Management_and_Secutity_with_the_ArchiMate_Language.pdf) of the ArchiMate language is an attempt to introduce risk and security modeling in ArchiMate language.

We propose a redesign of security aspects of this overlay, in order to improve ArchiMate security modeling capabilities.

## Project Structure
