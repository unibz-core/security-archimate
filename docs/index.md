## An Ontology-Driven Approach to Value, Risk, and Security Modeling in ArchiMate

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10005209.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10005209)

[ArchiMate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate) is an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language to support the description, analysis, and visualization of architecture within and across business domains. ArchiMate is a technical standard from The Open Group. It is based on concepts from the now-superseded IEEE 1471 standard.

The ["Risk and Security Overlay”](https://pure.unamur.be/ws/portalfiles/portal/12366722/Modeling_Enterprise_Risk_Management_and_Secutity_with_the_ArchiMate_Language.pdf) of the ArchiMate language is an attempt to introduce risk and security modeling in ArchiMate language.

Through an ontological approach, we propose redesigning the risk and security aspects of this overlay to improve ArchiMate's risk management modeling capabilities. Moreover, we propose a pattern language to introduce notions related to value into ArchiMate.

This website supplements our publications in this matter and serves as official documentation.
