### 1. Control Capability

> A *Control Capability* is a capability whose manifestation is a *Control (Protection) Event*.

In ArchiMate, a *Control Capability* is represented by a *Capability* associated with *Control (Protection) Event*.

A *Security Mechanism* aggregates *Control Capabilities*. However, other objects may also have one or more *Control Capabilities*.

**Examples:** Antivirus software has *Control Capabilities* to scan and eliminate malware. Air defense systems have *Control Capabilities* to intercept certain air threats. Warning signs have *Control Capabilities* to dissuade people from doing certain things.

<!-- TOC --><a name="control-event"></a>
### 2. Control Event

> A *Control Event* (or *Protection Event*) is an event that prevents, directly or indirectly, *Threat Events* or *Loss Events* of a certain type.

In ArchiMate, a *Control Event* is represented by an event that must negatively influence the «Likelihood» associated with events stereotyped with «ThreatEvent» or «Loss Event».

*Control Events*, directly, realize a *Goal* stereotyped with «ControlObjective» or, indirectly, realize it via the realization of a *Requirement* stereotyped with «ControlMeasure», which should realize that *Goal*.


*Control Events* are manifestations of *Control Capabilities* which they are associated with.

**Examples:** To realize the «ControlObjective» *Goal* of preventing software failure, removing permission to commit to the repository can be an adequate *Control Event*. Rocket interception can be a *Control Event* as manifestation of an air defense system's *Control Capabilities*; by doing so, the rocket interception event realizes the «ControlObjective» *Goal* of preventing damage to a given factory.

<!-- TOC --><a name="control-measure"></a>
### 3. Control Measure

> In a risk analysis process, a *Control Measure* is a specification of an action or set of actions that have to be performed or that should be implemented as part of the control, treatment, and mitigation of a particular risk.

In ArchiMate, a *Control Measure* is represented by a *Requirement* with the stereotype «ControlMeasure». A *Control Measure* is realized by the implementation of a *Security Mechanism* or by a *Control Event*.

**Examples:** Enforcing no-logs policy within a VPN company. Autoupdate feature of a piece of software. Warning signs nearby dangerous places inside a factory.


📝 **Note:** A *Control Measure* is a *Requirement* and, as such, a proposition or statement. It is not a concrete thing. For example, the warning signs above correspond to the proposition regarding employing them; the warning signs themselves can be seen as *Security Mechanism*, placed by an implementation event assigned to a *Security Designer*.

<!-- TOC --><a name="control-objective"></a>
### 4. Control Objective

> A *Control Objective*  is a high-level goal that should be realized by one or more *Control Measures*.

In ArchiMate, a *Control Objective* is represented by a *Goal* stereotyped with «ControlObjective». A *Control Objective* is realized by a a *Requirement* stereotyped with «ControlMeasure».

**Examples:** Preventing work accidents. Preventing data breaches. Preventing software failure.

<!-- TOC --><a name="disposition"></a>
### 5. Disposition

> A *Disposition* is a property of being disposed in some specific way. It refers to possible behaviors something may have under certain conditions.

In ArchiMate, a *Disposition* is represented by a *Capability*.  Abilities, capabilities, capacities, tendencies, powers, liabilities, vulnerabilities, and similar terms refer to *Dispositions*, in this sense.

**Examples:** Flamability of a piece of wood. Vulnerability of an employee to fall for a phishing attack. Commit permission.

<!-- TOC --><a name="hazard-assessment"></a>
### 6. Hazard Assessment

> A *Hazard Assessment*, proposed to represent UFO situations that activate *Threat Capabilities*, is an identified state of affairs that increases the likelihood of a *Threat Event* and, consequently, of a *Loss Event*.

In ArchiMate, a *Hazard Assessment* is an assessment stereotyped with «HazardAssessment».


**Examples:** Employees working too many hours. Disorganized work place in a factory. Unclear procedures for emergency.

<!-- TOC --><a name="intention"></a>
### 7. Intention

> An *Intention* is an internal mode of an agent that is committed to the realization of a goal, which is the propositional content of the *Intention*.

In ArchiMate, an *Intention* is represented by a *Goal*.

**Examples:** Hacker's intention to hack a company. Robber's intentions. Competitor's intentions.


<!-- TOC --><a name="likelihood"></a>
### 8. Likelihood

> A *Likelihood* assignment refers to the chances of occurrence of certain types of events or the chances of events to cause (or be followed by) other events.

In ArchiMate, *Likelihood* is represented by an *Assessment* with the stereotype «Likelihood», which can be connected to an event or the triggering association between events. Since there is no sense in assigning likelihood to individual events, the likelihood assignment should be understood as describing regularities, so applicable to types of events.

Events that prevent others from happening can be understood as negatively influencing the likelihood of the occurrence of the latter.

**Examples:** 20% likelihood of data breaches. 30% likelihood of vulnerability exploitation causing data breaches.

<!-- TOC --><a name="loss-event"></a>
### 9. Loss Event

> *Loss Events* are events that compromise (negatively impact) stakeholders' goals.

In ArchiMate, *Loss Events* are events stereotyped with «LossEvent». There is a negative *influences* association between a *Loss Event* and a *Goal* of a given Agent (a *Risk Subject*), which captures why an event is considered a loss. Loss events are caused (triggered) by *Threat Events*.

**Examples:** Production loss event hurts the Business owner's goal of maximizing production.

<!-- TOC --><a name="object-at-risk"></a>
### 10. Object at Risk

> An *Object at Risk* is an asset or resource at stake, i.e., the thing that may be harmed or damaged in a *Loss Event*.

In ArchiMate, an *Object at Risk* is represented by a Structure Element stereotyped with «AssetAtRisk».

In the risk ontology, we distinguish two roles played by objects in a *Risk Experience*, namely the OBJECT AT RISK and the *Threat Enabler*. In both cases, the dispositions of these objects enable the occurrence of threat and *Loss Events*. The difference between them is that the former is the thing at stake (i.e., the thing that may be harmed or damaged in a *Loss Event*), whilst the latter is simply a risk-enabling thing, as it is not exposed to any potential damage.


**Examples:** To exemplify this distinction between an *Object at Risk* and a *Threat Enabler*, consider that a machine failed and caused a production loss. It was the machine’s vulnerability that caused it to fail. Still, the integrity of the machine might not be affected by the failure at all. In this case, the machine is playing the role of a *Threat Enabler*.

<!-- TOC --><a name="protected-subject"></a>
### 11. Protected Subject

> A *Protected Subject* is an agent whose goals are protected by the effects (*Control (Protection) Events*) of a *Security Mechanism*.

This protection effect is the prevention of *Risk Events* (*Threat* or *Loss Events*) that could hurt the agent's goals.

In ArchiMate, a *Protected Subject* is represented by a specialization of *Risk Subject* associated with a «ControlObjective»

The *Protected Subject* specializes *Risk Subject*, though some *Risk Subjects* might not be *Protected Subject* due to lack of protection.

**Examples:** For example, a company has a *Control Objective* of protecting customers’ data from cyberattacks. Based on an assessment, a series of *Control Measures* should be implemented by the company’s cybersecurity team, playing the role of *Security Designer*; both the company and the customers may be regarded as *Protected Subjects* since they have assets at risk that should be protected.

<!-- TOC --><a name="protection-trigger"></a>
### 12. Protection Trigger

> A *Protection Trigger* corresponds to certain state of affairs or environmental conditions that activate *Control Capabilities*.

In ArchiMate, a *Protection Trigger* is represented as an *Assessment* stereotyped with «ControlAssessment».

The advantage of explicitly accounting for the situations that trigger the *Protection (Control) Event* is that we can represent how several environmental factors increase the effectiveness of the *Security Mechanism*, assuming its effectiveness is directly connected to how likely it works properly, manifesting the *Protection Event*.

**Examples:** A circuit breaker manifests its capability of interrupting a current flow when a fault condition is detected (heating or magnetic effects of electric current).

<!-- TOC --><a name="quality"></a>
### 13. Quality

> In the Unified Foundational Ontology, a *quality* is an objectification of a property that can be directly evaluated (projected) into certain value spaces.

In ArchiMate, a *quality* is represented as a Driver stereotyped with «Quality». Specific values are assigned through an assessment associated with the «Quality» Driver.

**Examples:** Consider an airplane seat (*Resource*) associated with seat width («Quality» Driver), associated with an assessment 43 cm. Other examples include the weight of a person, which can be measured in kilograms or pounds, and the color of a flower, which can be specified in RGB or HSV.

<!-- TOC --><a name="risk-experience"></a>
### 14. Risk Experience

> A *Risk Experience* corresponds to a complex or compound event composed of *Risk Events* (*Threat* or *Loss Events*) where the relevant entities take place, including a *Risk Subject*, *Object At Risk*, *Threat Agents*, etc.

According to COVER, risk is always experiential. Although we speak of *Objects at Risk* and *Threat Objects* in ordinary language, the risk is derived from *Risk Assessment* of *Risk Experiences* wherein those objects participate. For example, to identify and assess the risks someone's smartphone is exposed to, it is necessary to describe (i) which goals depend on the functional smartphone (getting in contact with friends, internet browsing, etc.); (ii) what can happen to the smartphone that could hinder its capability to achieve those goals; (iii) which events could cause events like these. Then, the risk the smartphone is exposed to is the aggregation of the risk of falling, breaking, being stolen, and so on. 

Risk is always relative. This means an event might be regarded as a *Threat Event* by one agent, whereas another agent perceives it as a *Opportunity Event*. For example, from the attacker's perspective, a successful phishing attack that compromises confidential information is seen as a *Gain Event*, a positive value event that brings about situations that satisfy the attacker's goals; however, from the victim's viewpoint (*Risk Subject*), it is a *Loss Event*, caused by a chain of *Threat Events*, that hurts their goals. The relativity of risks comes from their negative impact on goals. If one is concerned about the confidentiality of their data, this is because the risk of compromising it jeopardizes their goals, such as data privacy or avoiding identity theft.

In ArchiMate, *Risk Experience* is represented as an Grouping element stereotyped with «RiskExperience»

*Risk Experience* aggregates the risk elements and the relations, including *Hazard Assessment*, *Threat Agent*, *Loss Event*, *Vulnerability*, *Asset at Risk*, and *Threat Enabler*.


**Examples:** The *Risk Experience* of a phishing attack involves all steps of the attack up to the data compromise, for example.

<!-- TOC --><a name="risk-driver"></a>
### 15. Risk

> Definition...

The second represents risk from a quantitative perspective, commonly described as probability × impact. We map this concept as a DRIVER stereotyped as RISK, as drivers represent “conditions that motivate an organization to define its goals and implement the changes necessary to achieve them”

Associated to this experience, there is RISK simply labeled “Production loss”, which reflects the likelihood that all the parts of the experience occur and cause each other, as well as on the quantitative impact of the potential losses. Lastly, the RISK ASSESSMENT “Risk of production loss is unacceptable” concerns the production loss RISK.

stereotyped with «Risk»


**Examples:** XXXX.

<!-- TOC --><a name="risk-subject"></a>
### 16. Risk Subject

> The agent whose *Intentions* (goals) could be affected by a potential loss.

In ArchiMate, a *Risk Subject* is represented as a Stakeholder associated with a Goal that is negatively impacted by a «LossEvent».

**Examples:** Business owner.

Normally, it is associated with a «ControlMeasure» element and assigned to the implementation of a *Security Mechanism*. A *Security Designer* is a role playing by a person or department, not a job.


**Examples:** IT team.
